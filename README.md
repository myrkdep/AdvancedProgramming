# AdvancedProgramming
A repository for the Advanced Programming course to store all related information.

## Exercise Rules
Students should submit their exercises on the LMS by the deadline.  
Exercises submitted after the deadline will have a 20% penalty and can't be submitted after class is started. Everyone should present their code in class.  
Grades will be submitted to this repository one week after the class and will be visible to the entire class. All answers including my own version will be available in this repo after submission of grades.
### Grades will not be changed after submission.
