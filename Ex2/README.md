# Exercise 2: Library Management System
### This exercises aim to make you comfortable with almost all OOP principles in action.

## Excersie Explanation:
In the main class the program is run in an infinite loop an should have these options:  
- Add Document
- Add Paper
- Add Book
- Print All
- Show number of added books

There should be and id that takes track of all the added things and also a sub id that takes track of each class individually.  
Document only has a name, Paper adds an authors, Book adds an ISBN(International Standard Book Number).  
Your program should handle addign multiple authors so keep that in mind in your design.  
Books can have ISBN-10 and ISBN-13. Your program should handle both cases and ISBN should be checked according to formula.  
## All the priniples thought in class should be used for this exercise.(constructor, overloading, toString, static, and ...)

### For this exercise you will get more hands on with your code so you need to search about different topics to implement the things i said.
