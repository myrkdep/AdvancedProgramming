# Exercise 3: Banking System
### This exercise aims to reinforce your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Exercise Explanation:
In this exercise, you will design a banking system using classes for customers, accounts (savings, checking, etc.), and transactions. Implement features like deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, and interest deposit.
Your program should run in an infinite loop and provide the following options:
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Transfer
- Generate Account Statement
- Proceed to Next Month  
Each customer should have a unique identifier. Accounts should be savings or checking, and each account should have its own unique identifier.

## Implementation should include OOP principles such as constructors, overloading, static methods, and more.
## Your implementation should demonstrate a solid understanding of OOP concepts and good coding practices. Research and incorporate necessary topics to fulfill the requirements effectively.
