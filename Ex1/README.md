# Exercise 1: Java Syntax Exercises
### Thess exercises aim to make you comfortable with the Java language using exercises from your last term.
### For these exercises, design decisions and formatting are important.
### All exercises should have a main function to run the program.

## Ex0-1:
Write a program that has an int variable named 'n' and prints this sequence:  
1  
1 2  
1 2 3  
...  
1 2 3 ... n

## Ex0-2:
Make a Triangle class and create a method named 'typeDefine' for it. This method returns the type of triangle as a string (Equilateral, Isosceles, Right Triangle, Normal).  
If the triangle is both a Right Triangle and Isosceles, you should return 'Isosceles Right Triangle'.  
For ease of use, define your variables as public and initialize them normally.

## Ex0-3:
Write a program that prints the first 9 digit prime numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Beware that int does not support such large numbers.

## Ex0-4:
Write a program that has an array of 10 unsorted numbers and a variable named 'n'.  
First, sort this array using bubble sort.  
Then search for 'n' inside the array. If 'n' is found, it should print its position, and if it's not found, it should print 'not found'.  
Both bubble sort and binary search should be implemented as functions.

## Ex0-5:
This exercise will be completed in the class next session.  
Make a class named Contact. This class should have a name and phoneNumber.  
For reasons that I will discuss in class, phoneNumber should be a string and not an int.  
Your class should have the toString method implemented so it can be printed inside the main function using print.
