# Exercise 0: Object Creation and Manipulation
### This exercise aims to reinforce your understanding of object-oriented programming principles through the creation and manipulation of Java objects.
## Instructions:
### House Class:
Create a House class with a minimum of four private attributes, such as numRooms, area, etc.  
Implement getter and setter functions for each attribute to ensure proper encapsulation and access control.  
### HousePrice Class:
Define a HousePrice class that includes a House object as one of its attributes.  
Implement a method named calculatePrice within the HousePrice class to compute the price of the house. Use an imaginary formula based on the attributes of the house.  
### Test Class:
Develop a Test class to execute the program.  
Within the Test class, instantiate a House object and a HousePrice object with the created house.  
Calculate the price of the house using the calculatePrice method and print out the details of the house along with the calculated price.  

# This exercise has intentional design flaw which will be discussed in class

# Additional Steps:
As discussed in class, remove the HousePrice class and embed the functionality as a method of House.  
Implement the way to print House class instances without getter functions and by just giving our object to print as argument.  
## Your code should have no design flaws this time.  
## Formatting is important.  
## Handling of edge cases is not needed for this exercise.
