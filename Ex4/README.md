# Exercise 4: Book Management System (REST API with Spark)
### This exercise aims to strengthen your grasp of rest-api principles by implementing a book management system using Spark.

## Exercise Explanation:
In this exercise, you will design a simple book management system using classes to represent individual books and a collection of books. Implement functionalities to add books to the collection and retrieve books.
Your program should provide the following functionalities:
- Add a Book to the Collection (api/v1/addBook)
- Retrieve Books from the Collection (api/v1/getBooks)
- getBooks can recive an optional parameter named isbn.

## Implementation should include OOP principles such as constructors, methods, and proper encapsulation.
## Your implementation should demonstrate a clear understanding of OOP concepts and adhere to good coding practices. Research and incorporate necessary topics to fulfill the requirements effectively.
